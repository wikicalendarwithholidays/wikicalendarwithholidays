However, there may be times when you need to delete an event from your calendar. In this article, we will discuss the steps you need to take to delete an event from your iPhone calendar in 2024.<\/p>\n<h2>Step-by-Step Guide<\/h2>\n<h3>Step 1: Open Your iPhone Calendar<\/h3>\n<p>To delete an event from your iPhone calendar, you need to first open the calendar app. This can be done by tapping on the calendar icon on your home screen.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 2: Find the Event You Want to Delete<\/h3>\n<p>Once you have opened your calendar, you need to find the event that you want to delete. You can do this by scrolling through the days or by using the search function to find the event.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 3: Tap on the Event<\/h3>\n<p>Once you have found the event, you need to tap on it to open it. This will bring up the details of the event.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 4: Tap on the Edit Button<\/h3>\n<p>To delete the event, you need to tap on the edit button in the top right corner of the screen. This will allow you to make changes to the event.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 5: Scroll Down to the Bottom of the Screen<\/h3>\n<p>Once you have tapped on the edit button, you need to scroll down to the bottom of the screen. This is where you will find the delete button.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 6: Tap on the Delete Button<\/h3>\n<p>When you have found the delete button, you need to tap on it. This will bring up a prompt asking if you are sure you want to delete the event. Tap on &#8220;Delete Event&#8221; to confirm.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 7: Wait for the Event to be Deleted<\/h3>\n<p>After you have confirmed that you want to delete the event, you need to wait for it to be removed from your calendar. This may take a few seconds, depending on the size of the event.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 8: Check Your Calendar<\/h3>\n<p>Once the event has been deleted, you should check your calendar to make sure it is no longer there. If it is still showing, you may need to refresh your calendar or restart your iPhone.<\/p>\n<h2>Question and Answer<\/h2>\n<h3>Q: Can I delete multiple events at once?<\/h3>\n<p>A: Yes, you can delete multiple events at once by selecting them and then tapping on the &#8220;Delete&#8221; button. However, this will delete all the selected events, so make sure you are certain before doing this.<\/p>\n<h3>Q: What happens if I accidentally delete an event?<\/h3>\n<p>A: If you accidentally delete an event, you can usually recover it by checking your deleted events folder. This can be found by going to &#8220;Settings&#8221;> &#8220;Calendar&#8221;> &#8220;Advanced&#8221;> &#8220;Deleted Events&#8221;. From here, you can recover any events that you may have accidentally deleted.<\/p>\n<h3>Q: Can I delete events from shared calendars?<\/h3>\n<p>A: If you have permission to edit a shared calendar, you can delete events from it. However, if you do not have permission, you will not be able to delete events from the shared calendar.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>Deleting events from your iPhone calendar in 2024 is a simple process that can help you stay organized and keep your calendar up-to-date. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can quickly and easily delete events from your calendar as needed.<\/p>\n<\/article>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<section>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How to create, edit, and delete calendar events on your iPhone or iPad\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.imore.com\/sites\/imore.com\/files\/styles\/xlarge\/public\/field\/image\/2014\/06\/create_calendar_event_iphone_ipad_howto_2.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.imore.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How to Add &amp; Delete Events from Calendars on iPhone &amp; iPad\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/cdn.osxdaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/how-to-add-delete-events-calendar-iphone-1.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>osxdaily.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Delete Calendar Event Iphone \/ How to Remove iPhone Calendar Virus How\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/imobie-resource.com\/en\/support\/img\/how-to-delete-calendar-events-on-iphone-ipad-1.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>ras-tafara.blogspot.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How to Delete, Update or add event in iPhone calendar iOS 10 HowToiSolve\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.howtoisolve.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Manage-iPhone-calendar-event-by-Edit-Update-or-Delete-700x500.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.howtoisolve.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How to add events to your iPhone&#039;s calendar in 2 ways, and edit or\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.businessinsider.in\/photo\/78049312\/Master.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.businessinsider.in<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\u0411\u043b\u043e\u0433 \u043e\u0431\u043e \u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c How to add Facebook Events to iPhone calendar (and\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/media.idownloadblog.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/delete-calendar-ios.jpeg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>yarsokoll.blogspot.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How to create, edit, and delete calendar events on your iPhone or iPad\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.imore.com\/sites\/imore.com\/files\/styles\/xlarge\/public\/field\/image\/2014\/06\/edit_calendar_event_iphone_update_howto.jpg?itok=oTj0J73U\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.imore.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How to disable suggested events in Calendar on iOS and Mac\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/media.idownloadblog.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/iOS-9-Calendar-suggested-events-iPhone-screenshot-002.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.idownloadblog.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<\/section>\n<!--CusAds0-->\n<div style=\"font-size: 0px; height: 0px; line-height: 0px; margin: 0; padding: 0; clear: both;\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How to Add &amp; Delete Events from Calendars on iPhone &amp; iPad from osxdaily.com Introduction Organizing your schedule on your iPhone is a great way to keep&#8230; <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"footnotes":""},"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/w1.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/583"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/w1.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/w1.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/w1.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/w1.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=583"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/w1.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/583\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/w1.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=583"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
