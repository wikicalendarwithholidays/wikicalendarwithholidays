This calendar outlines the schedule for the school year, including important dates such as holidays, breaks, and professional development days. As a parent or student, it&#8217;s essential to be aware of these dates to plan ahead and ensure a successful academic year.<\/p>\n<h3>What Is LAUSD?<\/h3>\n<p>LAUSD is the largest public school district in California, serving over 600,000 students in the Los Angeles area. It operates over 1,000 schools and employs over 60,000 teachers, administrators, and staff members. The district is committed to providing high-quality education to its students and preparing them for success in college and the workforce.<\/p>\n<h3>When Does the 2024-2025 School Year Start and End?<\/h3>\n<p>The 2024-2025 school year for LAUSD will begin on Monday, August 19, 2024, and end on Friday, June 6, 2025. This includes 180 instructional days for students, as mandated by the state of California. The district has built in several breaks and holidays throughout the year to ensure students have time to rest and recharge.<\/p>\n<h3>What Are Some Important Dates to Remember?<\/h3>\n<p>Some important dates to remember for the 2024-2025 school year include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>First Day of School: Monday, August 19, 2024<\/li>\n<li>Thanksgiving Break: Monday, November 25, 2024 &#8211; Friday, November 29, 2024<\/li>\n<li>Winter Break: Monday, December 23, 2024 &#8211; Friday, January 3, 2025<\/li>\n<li>Spring Break: Monday, March 24, 2025 &#8211; Friday, March 28, 2025<\/li>\n<li>Last Day of School: Friday, June 6, 2025<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>What Is the Schedule for Professional Development Days?<\/h3>\n<p>LAUSD has built in several professional development days throughout the year to provide teachers and staff with opportunities for training and collaboration.

A holiday is a day when both students and staff are off from school. Holidays may include federal or state holidays, as well as days recognized by the district.<\/p>\n<h3>Are There Any Minimum Days During the School Year?<\/h3>\n<p>Yes, LAUSD has built in several minimum days throughout the year. These are days when students are dismissed early to allow for teacher planning and collaboration time. The minimum days for the 2024-2025 school year have not yet been announced, but will be included in the official instructional calendar.<\/p>\n<h3>What Happens If My Child Misses School?<\/h3>\n<p>Attendance is critical to student success, and LAUSD has strict attendance policies in place. If your child misses school, you will need to provide a valid excuse, such as illness or a family emergency. If your child has too many unexcused absences, you may be contacted by school officials and required to attend a meeting to discuss the issue.<\/p>\n<h3>Is There After-School Care Available?<\/h3>\n<p>Yes, LAUSD offers after-school care programs through its Beyond The Bell program. These programs provide a safe and enriching environment for students after school hours. To enroll your child, contact your school&#8217;s office or visit the Beyond The Bell website for more information.<\/p>\n<h3>How Can I Get Involved in My Child&#8217;s School?<\/h3>\n<p>Parent involvement is essential to student success, and there are many ways you can get involved in your child&#8217;s school. You can attend parent-teacher conferences, volunteer in the classroom or at school events, join the parent-teacher association or school site council, or simply stay informed about school news and events. Contact your child&#8217;s school to find out how you can get involved.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>The LAUSD 2024-2025 instructional calendar provides a roadmap for the upcoming school year, including important dates and events. As a parent or student, it&#8217;s essential to be aware of these dates to plan ahead and ensure a successful academic year.
