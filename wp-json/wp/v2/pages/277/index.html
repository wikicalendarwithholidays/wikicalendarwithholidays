While this can be helpful for keeping track of important dates, it can also clutter your calendar and make it difficult to find the events that matter most to you. In this article, we&#8217;ll show you how to delete certain holidays from your iPhone calendar for the year 2024.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 1: Open your Calendar App<\/h3>\n<p>The first step is to open your iPhone&#8217;s calendar app. Once you&#8217;re in the app, select the &#8220;Year&#8221; view. This will show you all the events that are scheduled for the entire year.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 2: Tap on &#8220;Calendars&#8221;<\/h3>\n<p>Next, tap on the &#8220;Calendars&#8221; button located at the bottom of the screen. This will show you a list of all the calendars that are currently active on your iPhone.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 3: Deselect the Holidays You Want to Delete<\/h3>\n<p>Scroll down until you see the &#8220;Holidays&#8221; section. Here, you&#8217;ll find a list of all the holidays that are currently displayed on your calendar. To deselect a holiday, simply tap on the circle next to it. Once you&#8217;ve deselected all the holidays you want to remove, tap &#8220;Done.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h3>Step 4: Confirm Your Changes<\/h3>\n<p>After you&#8217;ve deselected the holidays you want to delete, you&#8217;ll be taken back to the calendar view. To confirm your changes, tap on the &#8220;Today&#8221; button located at the bottom of the screen. This will bring you back to the current date, and you should see that the holidays you deselected are no longer displayed on your calendar.<\/p>\n<h2>Question and Answer<\/h2>\n<h3>Q: Can I Delete All Holidays from My iPhone Calendar?<\/h3>\n<p>A: Yes, you can. To delete all holidays from your iPhone calendar, simply follow the same steps outlined in this article, but deselect every holiday in the &#8220;Holidays&#8221; section.<\/p>\n<h3>Q: Will Deleting Holidays from My iPhone Calendar Affect Other Apps?<\/h3>\n<p>A: No, deleting holidays from your iPhone calendar will not affect any other apps on your device. However, if you have synced your calendar with other devices or services, the changes you make on your iPhone may be reflected on those devices as well.<\/p>\n<h3>Q: Can I Add Custom Events to My iPhone Calendar?<\/h3>\n<p>A: Yes, you can. To add custom events to your iPhone calendar, simply tap on the &#8220;+&#8221; button located at the top right corner of the screen. From there, you can enter the event details, including the date, time, and location.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>By following these simple steps, you can easily delete certain holidays from your iPhone calendar for the year 2024.
