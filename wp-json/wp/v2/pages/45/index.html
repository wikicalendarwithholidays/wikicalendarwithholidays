To do this, navigate back to the calendar view and select the day, week, or month where the appointment is scheduled. You should see the appointment displayed on the calendar.<\/p>\n<h2>Step 8: Edit or Delete the Appointment<\/h2>\n<p>If you need to make changes to the appointment or delete it, you can do so by clicking on the appointment in the calendar view.
