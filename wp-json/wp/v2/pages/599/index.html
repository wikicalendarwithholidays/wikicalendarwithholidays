The Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) has released the public schools calendar for 2024, which includes important dates such as the first day of school, holidays, and breaks. In this article, we will go over everything you need to know about the Los Angeles public schools calendar for 2024.<\/p>\n<h2>When Does School Start?<\/h2>\n<p>The first day of school for the 2024-2025 academic year is August 20, 2024. This date applies to all LAUSD schools, including traditional, year-round, and magnet schools. It is important to note that this date may vary for charter schools or private schools in the area.<\/p>\n<h2>What Are the Holidays and Breaks?<\/h2>\n<p>LAUSD observes a number of holidays and breaks throughout the school year.
