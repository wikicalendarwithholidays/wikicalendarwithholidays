It is based on the traditional Chinese lunisolar calendar, which is different from the Gregorian calendar used in the Western world. Each year is associated with a specific zodiac animal, and there are various customs, symbols, and taboos associated with the occasion.<\/p>\n<h2>What is the Chinese Lunar New Year Calendar?<\/h2>\n<p>The Chinese Lunar New Year Calendar is a cyclical system that combines lunar and solar elements. It is based on the cycles of the moon phases and the movement of the sun, as well as the traditional Chinese astrology and cosmology. Each year is divided into 12 lunar months, with each month starting on the day of the new moon. The length of each month varies from 29 to 30 days, depending on the moon&#8217;s orbit. In order to align the lunar calendar with the solar year, an extra month is added every few years, resulting in a leap year. The Chinese Lunar New Year usually falls between January 21 and February 20 on the Gregorian calendar.<\/p>\n<h3>The Year of the Dragon<\/h3>\n<p>The Chinese zodiac is a 12-year cycle, with each year associated with a specific animal.
