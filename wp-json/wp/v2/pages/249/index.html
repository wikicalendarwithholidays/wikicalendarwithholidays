It is a helpful tool for people who want to eat fresh, locally-grown fruits and vegetables.<\/p>\n<h3>Why Use a Farm Share Calendar?<\/h3>\n<p>Using a farm share calendar allows you to plan your meals around what is in season. This can help you save money on groceries and support local farmers. It also ensures that you are eating fresh, nutritious food that is good for your health.<\/p>\n<h2>The Benefits of Eating Locally-Grown Produce<\/h2>\n<p>There are many benefits to eating locally-grown produce. Here are just a few:<\/p>\n<h3>1. It is Fresh and Nutritious<\/h3>\n<p>When you buy produce from a local farm, it is usually picked within a day or two of being sold. This means that it is fresher and more nutritious than produce that has been shipped from far away.<\/p>\n<h3>2. It Supports Local Farmers<\/h3>\n<p>Buying locally-grown produce supports the local economy and helps small farmers stay in business. This is important because many small farmers struggle to compete with large, industrial farms.<\/p>\n<h3>3. It is Better for the Environment<\/h3>\n<p>Buying locally-grown produce reduces the carbon footprint of your food. This is because it does not have to be transported long distances, which requires a lot of energy and contributes to air pollution.<\/p>\n<h2>The Farm Share Calendar for Jacksonville FL in 2024<\/h2>\n<p>Here is the farm share calendar for Jacksonville FL in 2024:<\/p>\n<h3>January-March<\/h3>\n<p>During these months, you can expect to find citrus fruits, such as oranges and grapefruits, as well as leafy greens like kale and lettuce.<\/p>\n<h3>April-June<\/h3>\n<p>As the weather warms up, you can expect to find strawberries, blueberries, and other types of berries, as well as tomatoes, cucumbers, and peppers.<\/p>\n<h3>July-September<\/h3>\n<p>During the summer months, you can expect to find sweet corn, watermelon, and other types of melons, as well as peaches and other stone fruits.<\/p>\n<h3>October-December<\/h3>\n<p>As the weather cools down, you can expect to find apples, pumpkins, and other types of squash, as well as root vegetables like carrots and potatoes.<\/p>\n<h2>Question and Answer<\/h2>\n<h3>Q: Where can I find a farm share calendar for my area?<\/h3>\n<p>A: You can usually find a farm share calendar by doing a quick internet search for your city or region.
