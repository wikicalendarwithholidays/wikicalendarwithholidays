One of the most important things to consider is the school calendar. In this article, we will take a closer look at the MTCS school calendar for 2024-2025 and answer some common questions.<\/p>\n<h2>When Will the School Year Start and End?<\/h2>\n<p>The school year for MTCS in 2024-2025 will start on August 26, 2024, and end on May 30, 2025. This includes a total of 176 days of instruction, which is the standard for Tennessee public schools.<\/p>\n<h2>What Holidays Are Included in the Calendar?<\/h2>\n<p>The school calendar includes several holidays throughout the year. The school will be closed on Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and the following Friday, Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, New Year&#8217;s Day, Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Presidents&#8217; Day, Good Friday, and Memorial Day.<\/p>\n<h2>What About Spring Break?<\/h2>\n<p>Spring break for the 2024-2025 school year will be from March 17-21, 2025.
