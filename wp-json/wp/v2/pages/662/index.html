It can be frustrating to have your schedule cluttered with events that you never added. Fortunately, there are steps you can take to remove spam from your iPhone calendar.<\/p>\n<h2>What is iPhone Calendar Spam?<\/h2>\n<p>iPhone calendar spam is when unwanted events appear on your calendar without your consent. These events are usually advertisements or invitations to click on a link. They can be annoying and distracting, and they may even contain harmful content.<\/p>\n<h3>How Does iPhone Calendar Spam Happen?<\/h3>\n<p>iPhone calendar spam can happen when spammers find a way to add events to your calendar without your knowledge. They may use a technique called &#8220;calendar phishing,&#8221; where they send you a fake invitation that, when accepted, adds the event to your calendar. They may also use automated tools to add events to many calendars at once.<\/p>\n<h2>How to Remove iPhone Calendar Spam<\/h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve already been targeted by iPhone calendar spam, don&#8217;t worry. There are steps you can take to remove it.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 1: Decline the Event<\/h3>\n<p>The first step is to decline the event. Tap on the event in your calendar and select &#8220;Decline.&#8221; This will remove the event from your calendar and send a message to the sender that you won&#8217;t be attending.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 2: Report the Event<\/h3>\n<p>The next step is to report the event as spam. Tap on the event in your calendar and select &#8220;Report Junk.&#8221; This will send a message to Apple that the event is spam, and they will investigate and take action.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 3: Block the Sender<\/h3>\n<p>If you continue to receive spam events from the same sender, you can block them. Go to your Mail app and find an email from the sender. Tap on their email address and select &#8220;Block this Contact.&#8221; This will prevent them from sending you any more invitations or emails.<\/p>\n<h2>Preventing iPhone Calendar Spam<\/h2>\n<p>The best way to deal with iPhone calendar spam is to prevent it from happening in the first place. Here are some tips:<\/p>\n<h3>Tip 1: Be Careful What You Accept<\/h3>\n<p>Be careful about accepting invitations from people you don&#8217;t know. If you&#8217;re not sure if an invitation is legitimate, do some research before accepting.<\/p>\n<h3>Tip 2: Use a Spam Filter<\/h3>\n<p>Use a spam filter on your email to prevent spam invitations from getting through. You can also use a third-party app to filter your calendar events.<\/p>\n<h3>Tip 3: Keep Your iPhone Updated<\/h3>\n<p>Make sure you keep your iPhone updated with the latest software. Apple frequently releases updates that fix security vulnerabilities and other issues.<\/p>\n<h2>Question and Answer<\/h2>\n<p>Q: Can iPhone calendar spam harm my device?<\/p>\n<p>A: In most cases, iPhone calendar spam is just annoying. However, some spam events may contain harmful content, such as malware or phishing links. It&#8217;s best to avoid clicking on any links in spam events.<\/p>\n<p>Q: Can I recover events that I accidentally deleted while removing spam?<\/p>\n<p>A: Unfortunately, once you delete an event from your iPhone calendar, it&#8217;s gone. Make sure you&#8217;re only deleting spam events and not legitimate ones.<\/p>\n<p>Q: Will reporting spam events to Apple help prevent future spam?<\/p>\n<p>A: Yes, reporting spam events to Apple helps them identify patterns and take action to prevent future spam. Make sure you report any spam events you receive.<\/p>\n<\/article>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<section>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How to Delete Spam Calendar Virus From iPhone Remove Calendar Spam\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/QT48-eE5Azo\/maxresdefault.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.youtube.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How to Delete iPhone spam calendar virus 2020 iOS 13 \/ Remove calendar\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/WnsUvg6rous\/maxresdefault.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.youtube.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How to Remove iPhone Calendar Spam Trend Micro News\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/news.trendmicro.com\/api\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/iStock-1029541906-1.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>news.trendmicro.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How to Delete Calendar Spam on Your iPhone\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.switchingtomac.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/08-Hide-Calendar-610x651.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>switchingtomac.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How to Stop (and Remove) iPhone Calendar Spam\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.rd.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/CalendarPhishing-ft-2-1024x683.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>link.technics-goods.info<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How to Stop iPhone Calendar Virus and Get Rid Of Spam Events\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.iphonehacks.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Delete-Spam-calendar-on-iPhone-and-iPad-.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>mumutechnology.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How to remove Calendar Virus\/Spam (Iphone, iPad, Mac)\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.myantispyware.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Iphone-Calendar-spam-example-2.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.myantispyware.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How to remove Calendar Virus\/Spam (Iphone, iPad, Mac)\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.myantispyware.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Iphone-Calendar-spam-example-1.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.myantispyware.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<\/section>\n<!--CusAds0-->\n<div style=\"font-size: 0px; height: 0px; line-height: 0px; margin: 0; padding: 0; clear: both;\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How to Delete Spam Calendar Virus From iPhone Remove Calendar Spam from www.youtube.com Are you tired of seeing spam events on your iPhone calendar?
