The Mayans had a complex calendar system that consisted of multiple cycles, including the Tzolk&#8217;in, the Haab&#8217;, and the Long Count. The Long Count is the most famous calendar cycle, as it is the one that predicted the end of the world on December 21, 2012.<\/p>\n<h3>What is the Tzolk&#8217;in?<\/h3>\n<p>The Tzolk&#8217;in is a 260-day cycle that was used for religious and ceremonial purposes. It is made up of 20 named days and 13 numbered days, which combine to form the 260-day cycle. The Tzolk&#8217;in was used to determine the best time for planting and harvesting crops, as well as for predicting the future.<\/p>\n<h3>What is the Haab&#8217;?<\/h3>\n<p>The Haab&#8217; is a 365-day cycle that was used for agricultural purposes. It is made up of 18 named months that are 20 days long, and one named month that is only 5 days long. The Haab&#8217; was used to track the seasons and determine the best time for planting and harvesting crops.<\/p>\n<h2>Today&#8217;s Date on the Mayan Calendar<\/h2>\n<p>Today&#8217;s date on the Mayan calendar is 13.0.11.9.3. This date is written in Long Count notation, which is a system of counting days that was used by the Mayans. Each day is numbered, and the numbers reset to zero after a certain amount of time has passed.<\/p>\n<h3>What Does Today&#8217;s Date Mean?<\/h3>\n<p>Today&#8217;s date on the Mayan calendar represents the end of a cycle and the beginning of a new one. The current cycle is known as the 13th B&#8217;ak&#8217;tun, and it began on August 11, 3114 BCE. The end of the 13th B&#8217;ak&#8217;tun occurred on December 21, 2012, which was the date that many people believed would be the end of the world.<\/p>\n<h2>Question and Answer<\/h2>\n<h3>Q: Is the Mayan Calendar Still Relevant Today?<\/h3>\n<p>A: Yes, the Mayan calendar is still relevant today. It is used by many indigenous communities in Central America for religious and cultural purposes. It is also studied by scholars and researchers who are interested in the history and culture of the Mayan civilization.<\/p>\n<h3>Q: Did the Mayans Predict the End of the World?<\/h3>\n<p>A: No, the Mayans did not predict the end of the world. The Long Count calendar simply marked the end of a cycle and the beginning of a new one. The idea that the Mayans predicted the end of the world on December 21, 2012, was a misinterpretation of their calendar system.<\/p>\n<h3>Q: What Can We Learn from the Mayan Calendar?<\/h3>\n<p>A: We can learn a lot from the Mayan calendar, including their advanced knowledge of astronomy and mathematics. We can also learn about their culture, religion, and way of life. The Mayan calendar reminds us of the importance of tracking time and the cycles of nature.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>Today&#8217;s date on the Mayan calendar represents the end of a cycle and the beginning of a new one. The Mayan calendar is still relevant today, and we can learn a lot from it. The Mayans were a fascinating civilization that made many contributions to the fields of astronomy, mathematics, and culture.<\/p>\n<\/article>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<section>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Mayan Calendar was wrong, the \u2018world will end on June 21\u2019, Conspiracy\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.lucipost.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Mayan-Calendar-lucipost-768x576.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.lucipost.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Mayan Calendar Comes to Life and Speaks Mayan Date as No One Could Hear\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/ww1.prweb.com\/prfiles\/2012\/06\/10\/9591187\/MayaCalendar_SunStone-Zoom.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.prweb.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\u2018World will end THIS YEAR just days before Christmas\u2019, according to the\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.the-sun.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/6\/2020\/06\/NINTCHDBPICT000592226599.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.the-sun.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"A Beautiful Wooden Mayan Calendar Mechanical Puzzle\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/laughingsquid.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Wooden-Mayan-Calendar-Date.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>laughingsquid.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Mayan Calendar Comes to Life and Speaks Mayan Date as No One Could Hear\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/ww1.prweb.com\/prfiles\/2012\/06\/09\/9591187\/MayaCalendar-Screen4.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.prweb.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"The Mayan calendar and some dates others&#039; have predicted would or will\" src=\"https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/originals\/f1\/21\/e1\/f121e1399060c6a8a2dabaa7ebd15156.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.pinterest.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Mayan Calendar infographic Karsten Ivey\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.karstenivey.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/MayanCalendarNI.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>karstenivey.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Top 10 Mayan Calendar Wall Decor Best Home Life\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/81bIaIPhN-L._AC_SL1500_.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>smarthomepromotion.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<\/section>\n<!--CusAds0-->\n<div style=\"font-size: 0px; height: 0px; line-height: 0px; margin: 0; padding: 0; clear: both;\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u2018World will end THIS YEAR just days before Christmas\u2019, according to the from www.the-sun.com The Mayan Calendar The Mayan civilization is known for its advanced knowledge of&#8230; <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"footnotes":""},"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/w1.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/979"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/w1.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/w1.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/w1.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/w1.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=979"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/w1.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/979\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/w1.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=979"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
