However, in previous years, the calendar has typically been released in the spring or early summer, so we can expect to see it sometime in the next few months. <\/p>\n<h3>What can we expect from the calendar?<\/h3>\n<p> While we cannot know for certain what the 2024-2025 calendar will contain, we can make some educated guesses based on previous years. We can expect to see the usual fall, winter, and spring quarters, as well as the traditional breaks for Thanksgiving, winter, and spring break. <\/p>\n<h2>Changes to the Calendar<\/h2>\n<h3>Will there be any changes to the calendar?<\/h3>\n<p> It is possible that there will be some changes to the calendar for the 2024-2025 academic year. For example, in recent years there has been a push to move the start of the fall quarter earlier in the year to align more closely with other universities. Additionally, there may be changes to the timing or length of breaks. <\/p>\n<h3>How will these changes affect students and faculty?<\/h3>\n<p> Any changes to the calendar will have an impact on students and faculty members at Cal Poly. Students may need to adjust their schedules or make different plans for breaks, while faculty members may need to modify their lesson plans or syllabi to accommodate the new calendar. <\/p>\n<h2>Important Dates<\/h2>\n<h3>What are some of the most important dates on the calendar?<\/h3>\n<p> Some of the most important dates on the Cal Poly 2024-2025 calendar will include the start and end dates for each quarter, as well as the dates for breaks and holidays. Additionally, there may be special events or deadlines that are specific to certain departments or programs. <\/p>\n<h3>How can students and faculty members stay informed about these dates?<\/h3>\n<p> The best way to stay informed about important dates on the calendar is to regularly check the Cal Poly website and other official communication channels.
