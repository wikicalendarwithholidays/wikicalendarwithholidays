As we approach the 2024-2025 academic year, it&#8217;s important to be aware of the school calendar and any changes that may impact students, parents, and staff. In this article, we&#8217;ll provide an overview of the MDCPS calendar for the 2024-2025 year, as well as answer some common questions.<\/p>\n<h2>What are the important dates for the 2024-2025 school year?<\/h2>\n<p>The first day of school for students in MDCPS is August 19, 2024. The last day of school is June 4, 2025. There are several holidays and breaks throughout the year, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Labor Day (September 2, 2024)<\/li>\n<li>Thanksgiving Break (November 25-29, 2024)<\/li>\n<li>Winter Break (December 23, 2024 &#8211; January 3, 2025)<\/li>\n<li>Spring Break (March 24-28, 2025)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that these dates are subject to change, and it&#8217;s always a good idea to check the official MDCPS calendar for the most up-to-date information.<\/p>\n<h2>What are the school hours?<\/h2>\n<p>The exact school hours vary by school, but most elementary schools in MDCPS start around 8:00am and end around 3:00pm. Middle and high schools typically start around 9:00am and end around 4:00pm. However, it&#8217;s important to check with your child&#8217;s school to confirm the exact hours.<\/p>\n<h2>What are the graduation requirements?<\/h2>\n<p>To graduate from high school in MDCPS, students must earn a minimum of 24 credits. These credits must be earned in specific subject areas, such as English, math, science, social studies, and electives. In addition, students must pass the Florida Standards Assessments (FSA) in English Language Arts (ELA) and Algebra I, as well as complete other graduation requirements such as community service hours.<\/p>\n<h2>What extracurricular activities are available?<\/h2>\n<p>MDCPS offers a wide variety of extracurricular activities, including sports, music, drama, and clubs. Students can participate in everything from basketball and soccer to marching band and theater. These activities not only provide students with an opportunity to explore their interests, but can also help them develop important skills such as teamwork, leadership, and time management.<\/p>\n<h2>What support services are available for students?<\/h2>\n<p>MDCPS provides a range of support services for students, including counseling, tutoring, and special education services. If a student is struggling academically or socially, they can receive support from trained professionals who can help them overcome challenges and achieve success.<\/p>\n<h2>How can parents get involved?<\/h2>\n<p>MDCPS encourages parents to get involved in their child&#8217;s education by volunteering, attending parent-teacher conferences, and joining the PTA. By working together, parents and educators can create a supportive environment that helps students thrive.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>The 2024-2025 school year is just around the corner, and it&#8217;s important for students, parents, and staff to be aware of the school calendar and any changes that may impact them. By staying informed and involved, we can ensure that our students have the best possible educational experience.<\/p>\n<h3>References:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.dadeschools.net\/calendars\/24-25\/24-25_el-sec.pdf\">MDCPS Elementary School Calendar<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.dadeschools.net\/calendars\/24-25\/24-25_ms-sec.pdf\">MDCPS Middle School Calendar<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.dadeschools.net\/calendars\/24-25\/24-25_hs-sec.pdf\">MDCPS High School Calendar<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Question and Answer:<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Q:<\/strong> When does the 2024-2025 school year start?<\/p>\n<p><strong>A:<\/strong> The first day of school for students in MDCPS is August 19, 2024.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q:<\/strong> What are the graduation requirements for MDCPS?<\/p>\n<p><strong>A:<\/strong> To graduate from high school in MDCPS, students must earn a minimum of 24 credits, pass the Florida Standards Assessments (FSA) in English Language Arts (ELA) and Algebra I, and complete other graduation requirements such as community service hours.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q:<\/strong> What support services are available for MDCPS students?<\/p>\n<p><strong>A:<\/strong> MDCPS provides a range of support services for students, including counseling, tutoring, and special education services.<\/p>\n<\/article>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<section>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Calendario 2022 Miami Dade\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/proxy\/geOUq_rLq9HBMSN-qSldasSJj-RW0Ci0CoLBsSypni56FfWgDpzPuddTTumdWLTSsvkJx9cr7IBVpW0h9c5lrE1_iqJp5obqmWgkkzr2g4PPMGoglTuGUpKZ0cpvbDtbOOvB9zsEMUGFkz_FsegeVxL1d-UQ4XP7k83aLKA_-WkDMQ=w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>2022spain.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Broward County School Calendar 2022 18 2022\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.schoolcalendars.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/official-2021-22-broward-county-public-schools-color-calendar.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.schoolcalendars.net<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"2021 2022 Miami Dade And Broward School Calendars 2024 Calendar Printable\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.2024calendar.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/2021-2022-miami-dade-and-broward-school-calendars.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.2024calendar.net<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"2020 And 2021 School Calendar Miami Dade\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/accalendar17.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/u-miami-calendar-2020-calendar-printables-free-templates-intended-for-miami-dade-public-school-calendar-2020-2021.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.narodnatribuna.info<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"MiamiDade revised school calendar CNW Network\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.caribbeannationalweekly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/OCT-12-CNW-NEWS-MDPS-School-Calendar-1068x1389.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.caribbeannationalweekly.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"MiamiDade Schools on Twitter &quot;MiamiDade County School Board Approves\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/EruOxAcXIAYdUAH.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>twitter.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Dadeschools Calendar 2024 2024 Calendar Printable\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.2024calendar.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/dadeschools-calendar-2021-to-2024-2024-calendar-printable.png?w=979&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.2024calendar.net<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Miami Dade School Calendar 2023 2024 Pdf Get Calendar 2023 Update\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/miamidadebrowardliving.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/2022-2023Miami-DadeSchoolCalendar_courtesy_of_Skilled_Real_Estate_Page_1-791x1024.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>year2023calendarcanada.github.io<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<\/section>\n<!--CusAds0-->\n<div style=\"font-size: 0px;
